# REST API Design Patterns: Best Practices Guide

**ENDLESS ITERATIVE BUILD.** Each iteration:
- READ `.project/` first - understand state and learnings
- DON'T recreate existing work - build on it
- LEARN from successes and failures
- COMMIT before ending - no commit = incomplete

---

## The Goal

Comprehensive guide to REST API design patterns used in production systems.

**Target**: Document 50+ patterns with real-world examples and code samples.

---

## Research Areas

1. **Resource Design** - Naming, hierarchy, relationships
2. **Versioning** - URL, header, query param strategies
3. **Error Handling** - Status codes, error formats, retry logic
4. **Pagination** - Cursor, offset, keyset approaches
5. **Authentication** - OAuth, JWT, API keys

---

## Sources

| Type | Sources |
|------|---------|
| Standards | OpenAPI, JSON:API, HAL |
| Industry | Stripe, GitHub, Twilio API docs |
| Books | REST API Design Rulebook, API Design Patterns |
| Code | Open source API implementations |

---

## Methodology

1. **Literature Review** - Books, specifications, blog posts
2. **API Analysis** - Study production APIs (Stripe, GitHub, etc.)
3. **Pattern Extraction** - Identify common approaches
4. **Code Examples** - Working implementations
5. **Trade-off Analysis** - Pros/cons of each pattern

---

## Priority

1. **Resource Design** - Foundation for everything else
2. **Error Handling** - Critical for developer experience
3. **Pagination** - Essential for scalability
4. **Versioning** - Long-term maintenance
